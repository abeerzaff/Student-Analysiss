        The dataset used in this project contains information about individuals and their sleep habits, alongside lifestyle and 
        health factors. Key features of the dataset include:
        - **Age**: The age of the individual.
        - **Gender**: Gender identity of the individual.
        - **Sleep Duration**: The average number of hours an individual sleeps per night.
        - **Quality of Sleep**: A subjective rating of sleep quality.
        - **Stress Levels**: The level of stress experienced by the individual.
        - **Physical Activity**: The individual's level of physical activity.
        - **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: A measure of body fat based on height and weight.
        - **Sleep Disorders**: Whether the individual has been diagnosed with a sleep disorder.

        The data serves as the foundation for uncovering patterns and correlations between these variables and sleep health.

        Through this analysis, we aim to answer several key questions:
        - How does **age** impact sleep duration and quality?
        - Are there any differences in sleep patterns based on **gender**?
        - What is the relationship between **stress levels** and sleep health?
        - How does **physical activity** influence the quality of sleep?
        - What is the prevalence of **sleep disorders**, and how does it relate to BMI and other factors?
        - What is the **optimal sleep duration** for achieving better sleep quality?

        The insights derived from this analysis can:
        - Help individuals understand how lifestyle changes may improve their sleep health.
        - Assist healthcare professionals in identifying patterns to recommend personalized interventions.
        - Raise awareness about the importance of addressing stress, maintaining a healthy BMI, and engaging in physical activity 
          to improve sleep.
